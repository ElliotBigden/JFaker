JFaker:
======

JFaker is a Java data generation library. It allows you to generate data of various types including: names, addresses, phone numbers, filler text, and more.

This project was heavily inspired by similar projects that exist in [PHP](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), [Perl](http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Data-Faker-0.07/), [Ruby](http://faker.rubyforge.org/), and [Python](https://github.com/joke2k/faker). The data set that this project uses is a direct port of the data set in the Python version.


Project Status:
==============
This project is still in very early development as the data from Joke2k's Python library is still being ported into an extensible format for the Java version.


Dependencies:
===========

We use Maven to build our dependencies.
